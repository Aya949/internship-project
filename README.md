# Prestations Lookup & Dashboard App

A Streamlit web application developed during my internship at La Fondation Mohammed VI de Promotion des Œuvres Sociales de l’Éducation-Formation. The app was designed to help internal employees quickly search, filter, and visualize data related to social benefits ("prestations") offered to Ministry of Education members.

## Features

-  **Search by Member ID:** Enter a "numéro d'adhérent" (member ID) to view all associated services and total amount.

- **CSV File Upload:** Upload a CSV file containing a list of member IDs to display and export their prestations.

- **Global Statistics:** View total costs, average amounts, and number of beneficiaries.

- **Filter by Prestation:** Select a type of prestation and interactively display key data columns.

- **Online Deployment:** Deployed with Streamlit Cloud for immediate access.
